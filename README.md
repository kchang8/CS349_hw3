In this assignment, you will bring up the CoffeeRun app and experiment with it by using its
FormHandler module to process data from a form submission. Complete the submission:
1. Work through Chapter 8 (Modules, Objects, and Methods) to create the DataStore and Truck
modules. Add .eslintrc.js to your repository, and be sure to fix any errors found by ESLint.
As you create the modules, be sure to test them interactively in the DevTools Console, as in Figures
8.10 and 8.32 from the textbook. Keep in mind that you can recall previously executed code using the
UP and DOWN arrow keys on your keyboard.
2. Complete Chapters 9 and 10 to create a form, style it with Bootstrap, and use jQuery to define a
FormHandler object.
3. Read the MDN articles Your First HTML Form
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Your_first_HTML_form and
How to structure an HTML form
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/How_to_structure_an_HTML_form, and
create a new HTML file with the payment form from the end of the second article.
4. Now, modify the payment form to load the FormHandler module and add a submit handler. (The
default handler action of logging to the console is fine for this step, but we’ll enhance the DOM
elements with jQuery.
5. Complete Chapter 11 to add the CheckList module to CoffeeRun and see how to create DOM
elements with jQuery.
6. Add the jQuery Modal plugin (https://jquerymodal.com/) to the page for the payment form you
created in Step (4) above. Modify the submit handler code to open a modal dialog box thanking the
user for their payment, using the title and name values (e.g., “Thank you for your payment,
Captain James T. Kirk”).
7. Push the contents of your project to a new GitHub repository. Do not push this assignment to the
same repository as your previous homework assignments.
